[LX Studio](http://lx.studio/) is a digital lighting workstation, bringing concepts from digital audio workstations and modular synthesis into the realm of LED lighting control. Generative patterns, interactive inputs, and flexible parameter-driven modulation â€” a rich environment for lighting composition and performance.

## Documentation

[LX Studio User Guide](https://github.com/tracyscott/RainbowStudio/blob/master/LXStudioUserGuide.md)

There is some minimal documentation on the
[LX Studio Wiki](https://github.com/heronarts/LXStudio/wiki).

Consult the [LX Studio API reference &rarr;](http://lx.studio/api/)

More and better documentation is coming soon!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an issue like the following on Linux:

```
com.jogamp.opengl.GLException: Caught ThreadDeath: null on thread main-FPSAWTAnimator#00-Timer0
    at com.jogamp.opengl.GLException.newGLException(GLException.java:76)
```

Then we recommend wiping your `.lxproject` file, selecting a `.lxp` file,
and rebooting RaveStudio twice. It was causing us issues, potentially due
to odd-sized windows.
