// with wrapper.  RaveModel3D should not extend LXModel and should encompass the Tori gate dimensions,
// etc.  It should have a method generateLXModel() that generates our points.  Also, there could be
// multiple versions of generateLXModel() that generate multiple light placement strategies but that
// ship has sailed.
